ccs2*
- values of primary resource parameters cannot contain single quotes
  (due to how xslt_id_friendly is expected to be used)

generic:
- clufter:descent-mix tags cannot be reasonably conditionalized,
  even if the condition is a constant expression known at the time
  of starting the transformation process;  using standard
  xsl:{if,choose,when,otherwise} tags could be too difficult
  to grasp (at both programmatic preprocessing and human comprehension
  meanings), but there could be a simplified clufter:* instruction
  set to support such compile-time (as opposed to run-time) branching


(surely there are more, either known or percepted by the 6th sense)
