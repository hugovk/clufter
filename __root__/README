 clufter (CLUster FilTER)
==========================

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./run-dev -h | sed '2,8p;d'

  Tool to perform various transformations on cluster configuration formats.

  Primarily aimed at (CMAN, rgmanager) -> (Corosync, Pacemaker) cluster stacks
  configuration conversion (following RHEL trend), the tool, however, offers
  more uses further extensible within the arranged commands-filters-formats
  plugin framework.


-------
 Usage
-------

The package can either be used as a separate CLI tool (as per *What*) or as
a Python library, which is the case, e.g., with `pcs`_.

.. _pcs: https://github.com/feist/pcs/


Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python-wise:

- `lxml`_ (``python-lxml``)

general:

- Python 2

  - 2.7 preferred

  - 2.6 with `ordereddict`_ or some kind of ``collections.OrderedDict``
    backport (#929258) required

- ``ccs_flatten``, embedded, originally ``pacemaker/extra/rgmanager``:

.. code-block:: bash

  ./configure --with-cman=1 && ( cd extra/rgmanager && make )


tests:

- outside of Python 2.7+, `unittest2`_ (``python-unittest2``) is needed

.. _lxml: http://lxml.de
.. _ordereddict: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ordereddict
.. _unittest2: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2

 Other remarks

Bash completion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For convenience, bash completion is at user's hands by just running within
the session:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ eval "$(clufter --completion-bash)"


Indeed, to make such a feature permanent, the produced script can be appended
to or referred from some relevant file like ``~/.bashrc``, or when
``bash-completion`` package installed, stored to ``~/.config/bash_completion``
(per-user) or ``/usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion`` (system-wide).
It's also possible this is already performed on the packaging level.
