clufter aka Cluster Filter
==========================

$ ./run-dev -h | sed '2,8p;d'

Tool to perform various transformations on cluster configuration formats.

Primarily aimed at (CMAN, rgmanager) -> (Corosync, Pacemaker) cluster stacks
configuration conversion (following RHEL trend), the tool, however, offers
more uses further extensible within the arranged commands-filters-formats
plugin framework.


Prerequisites
-------------

Python-wise:
- lxml (python-lxml)

general:
- Python 2
  - 2.7 preferred
  - 2.6 with https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ordereddict or some kind
    of collections.OrderedDict backport (#929258) required
- ccs_flatten from pacemaker/extra/rgmanager:
  ./configure --with-cman=1 && pushd extra/rgmanager && make; popd

tests:
- outside of Python 2.7+, unittest2 (python-unittest2) is needed


    
TBD


Other remarks
-------------

For convenience, bash completion is at user's hands by just running within
the session:

$ eval "$(clufter --completion-bash)"

Indeed, to make such a feature permanent, the produced script can be appended
to or referred from some relevant file like ~/.bashrc, or when bash-completion
package installed, stored to ~/.config/bash_completion (per-user) or
/usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion (system-wide).  It's also
possible this is already performed on the packaging level.
