clufter aka Cluster Filter
==========================

Toolset for cluster config conversion, primarily from cluster.conf
as recognized by CMAN-based cluster to something to configure your
Pacemaker-based one (with optional get-ready heavy lifting by pcs).


Prerequisites
-------------

Python-wise:
- lxml (python-lxml)

general:
- Python 2
- ccs_flatten from pacemaker/extra/rgmanager:
  ./configure --with-cman=1 && cd pacemaker/extra/rgmanager && make

tests:
- outside of Python 2.7+, unittest2 (python-unittest2) is needed


Concepts
--------

There are a few concepts that tries to unify effective conversion
recipes in a relatively loosely coupled way and with clear
relationships:

  - command is a composition of one or more filters (see below)
    with some level of flexibility (tee-like splits, etc.)

  . filter is an isolated set of steps from object _A_ of a format _X_
    (see below) and having the respective internal representation _x_
    to the same or modified object _A'_ of a format _Y_ and having
    the respective internal representation _y_ (possibly _X_=_Y_
    and/or _x_=_y_, whereas string representation is frequented)

  . format is something having possibly many more-or-less interchangeable
    representations (string, parsed XML/ElementTree, ...), whereas
    the possible format transitions depend on the available filters;
    note that the format alone does not fully specify/restrict the set
    of values/properties of objects being held as these are further
    refined by previously used uni-format filters (context of
    previous transitions plays the role)
