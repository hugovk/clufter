        Parameters:
            filter_chain: particular scalars and vectors (variable depth)
                          representing graph of filters that form this command

        Note on graph representation within filter_chain:

                 __B    ___D
                /      /
            A--<___C--<             in ----------------> out
                       \
            O___________>--P


        graph with letter denoting the filters and with the left->right
        direction of flow from the inputs towards outputs (final outputs
        at terminals: B, D, P), is encoded as:

            ((A, B, (C, D, P)), (O, P), )

        where, for filter X (in {A, ..., D, O, P} for the example at hand):

            EXPRESSION  ::= UPFILTERS
            UPFILTERS   ::= TERMINAL | ( FILTERS )
            FILTERS     ::= FILTER, | FILTERS FILTER
            FILTER      ::= TERMINAL | PASSDOWN
            TERMINAL    ::= X
            PASSDOWN    ::= (X, DOWNFILTERS)
            DOWNFILTERS ::= FILTERS

        where:
            - {UP,DOWN}FILTERS dichotomy is present only as
              a forward-reference for easier explanation
            - there is a limitation such that each filter can
              be contained as at most one node in the graph as above
              (this corresponds to the notion of inputs merge for
              the filter, as otherwise there would be ambiguity:
              in the selected notation, can the filter occurences stand
              for unique nodes?  remember, filters as singletons)
            - UPFILTERS ::= TERMINAL is a syntactic sugar exploiting
              unambiguity in converting such expression as (TERMINAL, )


        Note on the decorated function:
            It should either return an iterable or behave itself as a generator
            yielding the items (at once) and on subsequent round triggering
            some postprocessing (still from decorated function's perspective).
            The items coming from the function encodes the protocols at
            the input(s) and the output(s) of the filter graph encoded in
            `filter_chain` and ought to reflect this processing construct
            as follows:
                1. for each UPFILTER in order, there is a tuple of two parts
                   1b. first part denotes the input (only single decl)
                   2b. second part denotes the output, which follows the
                       branch of filter chain pertaining the particular
                       UPFILTER, and can be either scalar or (arbitrarily)
                       nested iterable to match that filter chain branch
                       (proper nesting is not needed, only the order is
                       important, see point 4.)
                2. if there is just one UPFILTER, the toplevel definition
                   can be just the respective un-nested item, as this case
                   is easy to distinguish and apply un-sugaring if applicable
                3. when there is the same filter down the line shared by
                   2+ UPFILTERs (cf. "limitation such that each filter" above)
                   the respective protocol encoding is expected just once
                   within the first(!) respective UPFILTER definition
                #-- not yet, if ever, as it is opposed by good diagnostics --
                #4. nesting of the second part of the tuple (2b.) is not
                #   strictly needed and only the order is important,
                #   as the association is performed on intercalated chains
                #   anyway (note that this is orthogonal to simplification 2.)

            for the graph above, it would be, e.g.,:

            (('Aproto', 'a-in.txt'),
                (('Bproto', 'b-out.txt'), (('Dproto', 'd-out.txt'), ('Pproto')))),
            (('Oproto', 'e-in.txt'), )

            #which, as per point 4., can be further simplified as:

            #(('Aproto', 'a-in.txt'),
            #    ('Bproto', 'b-out.txt'), ('Dproto', 'd-out.txt'), ('Pproto')),
            #(('Oproto', 'e-in.txt'), )
