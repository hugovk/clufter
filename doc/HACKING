Notable points
--------------

1. plugins has to use absolute (clufter.*) imports otherwise issues can
   occur in some contexts of use

2. please use only lower-cased identifiers for plugins, UPPER-CASED are
   reserved for implicit ones (technically, not plugins, but can be used
   on a few places accepting plugins) such as XML


Common problems run into (just for self-reference)
