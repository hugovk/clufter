Preface
=======

This document elaborates on how selected cluster properties formalized
by the means of LTL logic maps to particular RGManager (R) and
Pacemaker (P) configuration arrangements.  Due to the purpose of this
document, "selected" here means set of properties one commonly uses in
case of the former cluster resource manager (R).

Properties are categorised, each is further dissected based on
the property variants (basically holds or doesn't, but can be more
convoluted), and for each variants, the LTL model and R+P specifics
are provided.

Other cluster properties
========================

Is-functioning cluster property
-------------------------------

FUNCTION(CLUSTER) ::= FUNCTION(CLUSTER, TRUE)
                    | FUNCTION(CLUSTER, FALSE)
. FUNCTION(CLUSTER, TRUE)  ... is functioning
. FUNCTION(CLUSTER, FALSE) ... is not

notes
. it is assumed cluster stack keeps running in both cases(!)
. see also 02/resource: MANAGED

R: driven by RGManager allowance/disallowance in cluster.conf
   - `/cluster/rm/@disabled`

P: driven by `stop-all-resources` (?)

FUNCTION(CLUSTER, TRUE)  [1. is functioning]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

R: `@disabled` either not specified or `0`

P: default, no need for that, otherwise specifying `stop-all-resources`
   as `false`
   # pcs property set stop-all-resources=
   # pcs property set stop-all-resources=false

FUNCTION(CLUSTER, FALSE)  [2. is not functioning]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

R: `@disabled` specified as `1` (nonzero?)

P: driven by specifying `stop-all-resources` as `true`
   # pcs property set stop-all-resources=true
